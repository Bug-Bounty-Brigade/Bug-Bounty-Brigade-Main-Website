# Contributing Guidelines

🎉 **First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute!** 🎉

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this project. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.


## How can I contribute? 🤔

### Reporting Bugs 💣

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report 📝, reproduce the behavior 💻 💻, and find related reports 🔎

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### Suggesting Enhancements 🛠

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion 📝 and find related suggestions 🔎.

Since the new GitHub Issue forms we only suggest you to include most information possible. But you can also **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/Bug-Bounty-Brigade/Bug-Bounty-Brigade-Main-Website/issues)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### Your First Code Contribution 🟩

Unsure where to begin contributing to this project? You can start by looking through these `good first issue` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Good first issues](https://github.com/Bug-Bounty-Brigade/Bug-Bounty-Brigade-Main-Website/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [hacktoberfest](https://github.com/Bug-Bounty-Brigade/Bug-Bounty-Brigade-Main-Website/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ahacktoberfest) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `hacktoberfest` issues.

### Pull Requests 📣

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain the project's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible!
- Enable a sustainable system for maintainers to review contributions



## Style Guide for Git Commit Messages :memo:

**How you can add more value to your contribution logs:**

- Use the present tense. (Example: "Add feature" instead of "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood. (Example: "Move item to...", instead of "Moves item to...")
- Limit the first line (also called the Subject Line) to _50 characters or less_.
- Capitalize the Subject Line.
- Separate subject from body with a blank line.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.
- Wrap the body at _72 characters_.
- Use the body to explain the _what_, _why_, _vs_, and _how_.
- Reference Issues and Pull Requests liberally after the first line.
- Follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

## Hacktoberfest Guidelines 🌳

#### Good Practice ✅

- Comment on the issue to get assigned
- Create an issue before you make a Pull Request

#### Bad Practice ❌

- Creating pull requests without issue assignment will not be accepted and will be closed.

After this, the project maintainers will review the changes and will merge your PR if they found it good, otherwise we will suggest the required changes.
